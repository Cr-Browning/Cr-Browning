### 👋 Hi there, I'm Cade Browning

- 🔭 I’m a Computer Science major at Western Carolina University (Class of Dec 2025), with a minor in Mathematics.
- 💼 I’ve interned with Trellix as a Public Sector Sales Engineer, where I delivered technical demos, built competitive strategy decks, and supported public-sector cybersecurity deployments.
- 🔐 I'm passionate about cybersecurity architecture (SIEM, SOAR, XDR, NDR, IDS/IPS, Zero Trust) and hands-on software development.
- 👨‍💻 I’ve built projects using Python, JavaScript, Rust, C, React, Django, JavaFX, and PostgreSQL—including a climate data visualization webpage and a two-player/four-player chess game.
- 🌱 Currently learning advanced Rust concurrency, Django REST APIs, and low-level C systems programming.
- 🌍 I speak English fluently, intermediate German, and beginner Spanish.
- 🧠 I’m interested in backend & full-stack development, cybersecurity engineering, data science, and applied math.
